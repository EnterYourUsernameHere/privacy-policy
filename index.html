    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This app (“the App”) is provided by the developer (“we”, “us”, “our”).
      Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to being transparent
      about how the App handles information.

    <p>
      We do not collect, store, use, share, or transfer any personal data from users.
      The App does not gather any information about your identity, device, or activity.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      The App may request certain permissions (for example, access to location,
      storage, or network) solely to provide its core features.
      No data accessed through these permissions is collected, transmitted, or stored by us.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>

      The App does not use any third-party analytics tools, advertising networks,
      tracking libraries, or external data collection services.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      Because we do not collect any data, we do not sell, trade, or share any
      user data with third parties.
